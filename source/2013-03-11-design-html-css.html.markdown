Prior to reading the first chapters of Jon Duckett's *HTML & CSS* I knew how to create a link to something external to the site that I was creating.  However, was not clear on how to create a link to a new page on the same site.  Duckett explains the difference between an absolute URL and a relative URL, both of which are used to create links from one page or site to another.  The basic difference is that absolute URLs are used when linking to another website and they begin with the domain name for that site and can be followed by the path to a spcific page.  Relative URLs, on the other hand, do not contain the site domain, but rather just the path to the html file that lives within the file-structure of the project.
