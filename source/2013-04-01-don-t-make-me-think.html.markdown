Steve Krugs's *Don't Make Me Think* may be ancient in tech-years, but so far it seems to be quite relevant to today's technology interfaces/experiences.  He touches on some principles of human behavior and design that are applicable to different contexts across time.  I find the anthropological side of web design quite fascinating.  Krug does a good job of making non-computer/website analogies to explain how humans would interact on web-pages.  For example, he correlates shopping mall and street sign experiences with the norms that people expect (and either do or don't get) on the web.  In a mall there might be people there to direct you around the mall, and employees of the stores to direct you to specific products.  Unfortunately, human direction and support is not an inherent part of the web experience, so we must design human-centered navigation that helps the user achieve his or her goals.  More thoughts on this in the works...
