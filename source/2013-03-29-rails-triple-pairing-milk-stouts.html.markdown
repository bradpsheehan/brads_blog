This e-commerce project is my first real experience with Rails.  I have found navigating the growing file structure of our application to be one of the consistently slow parts of my work flow.  Once I get used to the function/purpose/responsibility of all of these app files, I will be able to spend less time figuring out where I need to be in my app structure and more time developing solutions to the problems at hand.  That being said, I feel like I am getting the hang of it.

My current group is great.  We have been experimenting with a triple pairing process and with doing pairing pretty much 100% of the time.  I know that not all companies function like this, but it has been a fun learning experience and just a great way to build camaraderie with my class mates.  There is a risk with triple paring that one person would be twiddling his or her thumbs, disengaged with the process.  That has, fortunately, not been the case with our group.
