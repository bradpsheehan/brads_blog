We are currently in the middle of our first individual project and it has been a good experience thus far.  While in the real world it is not very realistic to think that I will be working completely, even this 'solo' project has been a collaborative effort with my fellow classmates, working more independently has been a good test of my programming knowledge and skills.  Seeing my strengths as well as the gaps in my understanding will help me grow and be able to contribute in a more meaningful way to our final group project and to projects in the professional world beyond gSchool.



Individual Project

Now that you’ve been working on your own for a week, how does it match up with your expectations? If you thought it’d be super hard, was it? If you thought you’d move incredibly quickly, did you?
Given that you’ve defined an MVP and are almost halfway through, do you feel like you’ve gotten half of the work done? If not, do you expect progress to speed up? Why?
Working on your own, do you feel like you’re spending more time stuck on problems or are you more likely to ask for help?
The Future

It’s seven weeks until we’re finished. What do you intend to focus on during that time? Why is that the most important thing?
During this last phase of the class, you’re taking on more and more responsibility for your own learning, development, and future. What people, knowledge, and resources are you cultivating to continue your growth?
Coming into the program you had an idea of what success looked like. Is it within reach? Or has your goal changed along the way?
