We are currently in the middle of our first individual project and it has been a good experience thus far.  While in the real world it is not very realistic to think that I will be working completely, even this 'solo' project has been a collaborative effort with my fellow classmates, working more independently has been a good test of my programming knowledge and skills.  Seeing my strengths as well as the gaps in my understanding will help me grow and be able to contribute in more meaningfully to our final group project and to projects in the professional world beyond gSchool.
