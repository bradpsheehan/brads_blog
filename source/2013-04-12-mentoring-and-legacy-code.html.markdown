This week I kicked off mentoring with Brian Rose.  Brian currently works for Factory Labs as the Director of Application Development, but will be helping Pivitol Labs open its Denver office in a month or so.  That will be sweet because I will likely see him at Galvanize more frequently.  Brian and I met earlier this week and got to know eachother a bit better.  He has an interesting background and a lot of programming experience for only being 27 years old.  So far, I have not tapped into Brian for all that much for assistance with the Son of Store Engine project, but will likely be doing that soon.  It is nice to know that I have him (and all of the other mentors) as a resource throughout the remain three months of gSchool.

The SoSE project has been difficult so far.  While we are making some progress, if feels a lot slower that the last project.  This might have something to do with the fact that we are working with a legcacy code base, and also something to do with the fact that I am still getting used to the way rails works.  Regarding the former, It is a bit tricky to work with code that I did not write and to add features without breaking existing ones.  Regarding the latter, working with a legacy code base would prbably not be as difficult if I was more familiar with rails, which would likely mean that I would know with more certainty where to look to solve various problems.  I'll get there, it will just take more practice.

While I am not feeling totally lost with rails, I do feel like I could benefit from a focus day, or two, or even a focus week on the rails.  I would like to find ways to practice with rails fundamentals while also working on our class projects.  It would be nice if there were some kind of rails warm-ups that are similar to the Ruby warm-ups that we do each morning.
