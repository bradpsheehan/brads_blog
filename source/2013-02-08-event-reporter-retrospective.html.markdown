The Event Reporter project introduced us to writing a program that would load a csv file, parse it's data, and allow the user to searching specific items within the data file.

My primary goal with this project was to get the basic functions working and to understand how I got them working.  Refactoring and extensions were a secondary goal.  Given that this was my second week really working with code, I was happy that, in the end and with the help of my peers along the way, my program accomplished the basic requirements and that I felt like I could explain the basic logic of the code.

I was happy that I did not have to pull an all-nighter for this project.  I don't tend to work well when it's late, but have had to do so in the past when my daytime schedule didn't allow me to get much work done.  For this project I would cut off my work at midnight and get up early if I needed to. My brain is much more alive in the morning.  I found that Raphael, Kareem, Laura, and Blair were able to explain things well to me as needed along the way.

Having this project under my belt, I feel like starting the next project will be a bit easier, even if the project is more complex.  One thing I might do differently in starting the next project is write out more pseudo-code and maybe even do some rough sketching (on paper) of what the program is intending to do.
