I found Olsen's description of the difference between symbols and strings to be helpful.  His basic point here is that strings are used to hold some data that we are processing and that symbols are used to 'stand for' something.  It was helpful to know that there can only every be one instance of any given symbol, whereas setting two variables equal to the same string does not make them the same object.  Knowing this basic difference of strings and symbols will help me know when to use one instead of the other.

Being new to programming and to the idea of object oriendted design, I found Olsen's chatper on objects to be informative and important.  While I am still wrapping my head around the idea of objects in programming, it is good to know that vitrually everything in Ruby is an object and that virtually all of these objects inherit a basic set of methods from the Object class.  It seems like it would be worth my while to get to know the object class so that I can utilize it more confidently and so that I can stay out of its way, which is to say that I don't necessarily want to recreate/override an Object method that already exists and not have it work as it should.

On the topic of Regular Expressions, they seem like they could be very useful, but before I reach for them as a tool, I feel like it would be good to get more of the Ruby basics solidified in my brain.  There is a lot of knowledge being put my way in gSchool and it is not quite time for me to add this next layer of complexity.
