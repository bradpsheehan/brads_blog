After six weeks of the course we had a focus week that helped lock in some of the gears of Ruby basics that were kind of 'slipping' (i.e. kind of catching but not enought to really keep up to speed) while I worked through the first couple of projects.  Now that we had this reivew, If feel more competent as a developer and like I will really be able to do and learn more from the rest of the course.  I am energized and ready for the next four months at gSchool and for moving into the professional world as a developer.  Of course, as alaways, there is lot more to learn!

I am excited about starting to ride Rails.  gSchool has done a good job of showing us the hard/long-hand way of doing things before showing us the "easier" or more efficient ways of doing things.  This seems to be the case with Rails.  I will be able to say more about what Rails 'helps' with or makes 'easier' after the StoreEngine project, but I can say right now that it seems like it wraps a helpful layer around a number of things that programmer would find tedious/repetetive.  It takes care of a lot of what I hear referred to as the 'boilerplate code.' That is, the seemingly repetitive code that shows up again and again in order to get some result that seems like it ought to be much simpler.  I'll get back to you in a few weeks with more thoughts on this based on my project experience.  I anticipate that Rails will make programming a lot more efficient in the short-term and long-term.  Right now, I would like to understand the basics of Rails (i.e. setup, file relationships, basics of what goes into those files). Moving forward, I would like to dispell, as much as possible, the 'Magic' to which people attribute Rails.  The more it is referred to as Magic, the less approachable it seems to me.  Afterall, it's not magic, it's logic.

Can't wait to see what I and my team produce this next time around.  More updates to come next week.
